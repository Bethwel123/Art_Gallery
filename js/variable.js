//Variables are storage containers for information referencing
//We define using two keywords, let and const:

//Variables defined  using let are mutable: the value referenced can be changed
// when coming up with the name of a variable, make it descriptive as possible
//an equal sign is used to 'assign' thye value to a variable name
let person_name = "Bethwel langat";
//To check on changes print information to the console : console.log
console.log(person_name)
person_name = "Jane";
console.log(person_name)

// const is immutable: cannot be changed
